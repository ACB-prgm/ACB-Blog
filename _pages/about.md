## A Simple Blog about Me, Data Science, and Python
I made this blog to make me a better programmer and data scientist. I love teaching, and learn by doing it. My hope is that something in this blog helps and/or entertains someone who stumbles upon it. Expect posts discussing concepts and methods in data science, Python,a nd programming in general, as well as some more personal posts.
## About Me
I've been programming in Python since January 2019, and doing data science since 2020. I also make video games as a hobby using the Godot game engine, and have a YouTube channel teaching others how to make games (link on the left). I originally picked up programming as a hobby, but as I finished my first year of medical school, I realized I enjoyed it more than anything I would be doing as a physician and changed paths. Feel free to have a look at my CV above if you are interested in more of my educational/professional career!
